## Day 1 

I made a simple background color picker to show cofffee colors! It also changes images once you clicked! I used onclick event listener instead of addEventListener. Personally, I dont use onclick event listener function but, I am curious what are the differences between onclick and addEventListener. 

Diffenences: 
| type              | addEventListener               | onclick                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| number of event   | many events                    | single event              |
| event propagation | can control with 3rd argument  | cant control              |
| how to add        | `<script>` or  JS file         | HTML attribute or JS file |
| compatibility     | Doesn't work on older IE       | works on all browsers     |

## Day 2

### Variables

- What is variable? How do you declare?
  - It is a named storage for data.
  - 3 ways to declare, `var`, `let` (this can be reassigned), and `const` (this cannot be reassigned)
- Use uppercase const to name the variable that is defined.
  - e.g. `const COLOR_ORANGE = '#FFA500'`
  
### Function

- Functions are the main "building blocks" of the programs. 
  - They aloow the code to be called many times without repetitions.

```js
function showMessage() {
  console.log( 'Hello everyone!' );
}
```
- Functions also take parameters or arguements inside the `()` after the function name.
- What to do if there is no parameters?
  - Function also takes a default value by changing `(name)` to `(name = 'Stranger')`
- How do you name functions?
  - Function is action and ususally name it with a verb
    - `get.....` - return a vale
    - `calc.....` - calc something
    - `create....` - create something
    - `check....` - check something

```js
// without default value
function showMessage(name) {
  console.log( 'Hello ' + name + '!' );
}

showMessage('Victoria') // Hello Victoria!

// with default value
function showMessage(name = 'Stranger') {
  console.log( 'Hello ' + name + '!' );
}

showMessage() // Hello Stranger!
```

## Day 3

### Function Expression

2 ways to declare functions:

```js
// first:  Function Declaration
function sayHi() {
  console.log("Hello");
}

// second: Function Expression
let sayHi = function () {
  console.log("Hello");
};
```

what are the differences between `function declaration` and `function expression`?

1. function declaration => declared as a separated statement in the main code flow
   - can be called earlier than it is defined.
     - for example, a global function declaration is visible in the whole script, no matter where it is.
2. function expression => created inside an expression with **assignment expression** `=`
   - Is created when the execution reaches it and is useable only from that moment

A function is a value, we can copy them. This also works with function expressions

```js
function sayHi() {
  console.log("Hello");
}

let anotherFunc = sayHi;

sayHi(); // Hello
anotherFunc(); // Hello
```

Also, function declarations are their block scopes. In short, if a function is declared inside the curly bracket, the function cant be called outside.

```js
let age = prompt("What is your age?", 18);

// conditionally declare a function
if (age < 18) {
  function welcome() {
    console.log("Hello!");
  }
} else {
  function welcome() {
    console.log("Greetings!");
  }
}

welcome(); // show error becasue it was declared inside the if else block
```

### Callback function

Let see this example, `ask(question, yes, no)` with 3 parameters:

- `question` => text of the question
- `yes` => the function will run if the answer is yes
- `no` => the function will run if the answer is no

```js
function showAgree() {
  console.log("You agreed.");
}

function showDisagree() {
  console.log("You disagreed.");
}

function ask(question, yes, no) {
  if (confirm(question)) {
    yes();
  } else {
    no();
  }
}

ask("Do you agree?", showAgree, showDisagree);
```

**The arguement `showAgree` and `showDisagree` are called callback functiopns or caallbacks**

**In most cases when we need to declare a function, Function declaration is preferable because it is visible prior to the declaration itself. More flexibility in code organization and is usually more readable**


## Day 4

### Arrow Function, the basics

There is another very simple and concise synthax for creating functions! It is the `arrow function`!


The general foramt shows below: 
```js
// arrow function
let func = (arg1, arg2, ..., argN) => expression;

//or 

const func = (arg1, arg2, ...args) => expression;
```

Let's see more examples!

Both functions below works the same way and will return the same value. The `arrow function` allows us to write one line code and without `return` keybord.

Let's break down on how to convert the function below to arrow function
```js
const sum = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

// first - remove "function" 
const sum = (a, b)
// second - add arrow =>
const sum = (a, b) => 
//third - add expression
const sum = (a, b) => a + b // no curly bracket, so the returen is not needed here

// you can also write like this if you need to pass more actions within the function
const sum = (a, b) => { // with curly bracket present, return is needed
 // do more than one thing
 let extra = 30
 return a - b + extra
}
```

Arrow function doesn't work with `this` keyword, so keep this in mind.

```js
// regular function
function logThis() {
  console.log(this)
}

document.addEventListener('click', logThis); // this will refers to the document

// arrow function
const logThisArrow = () => {
  console.log(this);
};

document.addEventListener('click', logThisArrow); // this will refers to the global object
```


## Day 5

### Loops

How do you write code that display numbers between 1 and 5? You could write like this below. But what if you need to write the exact same code for numbers between 1 and 100? 

```js
console.log(1);
console.log(2);
console.log(3);
console.log(4);
console.log(5);
```

Couple wasy to write repeated statement

### the `while` loop

```js
while (condition) {
  // do something
}

// example
let number = 1; // declare the variable and assign 1
while (number <= 5) {
  console.log(number);
  number++;
}
```

The condition in parentheses is evaluted to determine whether it is true or not.
  - if `true`, the code in the while loop's body wrtie. And then it continues running until the condition is evaluted to false
  - if `false , the code stop run or doesn't run.

### the `for` loop

```js
for (initailization; condition; final expression) {
  // do something
}

// example
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log(i); // logging number 1 to 5
}
```
- `initalization` - it is to set initial value of the variable, such as `let i = 0`
- `condition` - it is to evaluated the condtion before the loop runs each time. 
  - if `true`, the code runs
  - if `false`, the code doesn't run
- `final expression` - it is oftne to update the value of the variable, such as `i++`


### Common mistakes

- the while loop

```js
let number = 1;
while (number <= 5) {
  console.log(number);
  // without number++, the variable is never updated and the loop conditon stays forever
}
```
It will cause the loops run forever and never stop. It also will crash your browser!

- the for loop

```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
  i++; // The i variable is updated in the loop body
}
// result: 1 3 5
```
In this case, the code is running incremeneted twice inside the paraenthese and curly bracket.

### FizzBuzz

The [rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz):
  - if the number is divisible by 3, log Fizz
  - if the number is divisible by 5, log Buzz
  - if the number is divisible by 15, log FizzBuzz

```js
for (let i = 1; i < 101; i++) {
  if (i % 15 === 0) {
    console.log("FizzBuzz");
  } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
    console.log("Fizz");
  } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
    console.log("Buzz");
  } else {
    console.log(i);
  }
}
```

## Day 6

### what is garbage collection?

In general, garbage is something that is no longer of use.  In JavaScript, it is a memory management that help us to managing memory space. What are things that take up memory? We declare variables and then assign values to them. e.g. `let message = 'Hello'` or `let a = 5` or etc.

But how does JavaScript know when something is not needed anymore? The main way to decide is `reachability`. In short, if the values are still **reachable** as in still accessible and usable, they will stay in the memory. 

There is a background process called garbage collector that monitors all objects and remove those values that become **unreachable**. And it is running automatically in the background.

For example,

```js
let user = {
  name: "John"
};
```

The `name: 'John'` is stored in the memory. 
Let's say we assign different value to `user`, `user = null` and what happened to `name: 'John'`? The name 'John'  becomes **unreachable**. As mentioned above, any vales become **unreachable" and the garbage collector will throw out the data and free up space in the memory.

## Day 7

### The `switch` statement

A `switch` statement can replace multiple `if` checks.

let's see `if else` function below. It can look really confused and get lost easily. A `switch` can offer readable code.

FizzBuzz example: 
```js
for (let i = 1; i < 101; i++) {
  if (i % 15 === 0) {
    console.log("FizzBuzz");
  } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
    console.log("Fizz");
  } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
    console.log("Buzz");
  } else {
    console.log(i);
  }
}
```

A `switch` statement looks like this:

```js
switch(x) {
  case 'value1':  // if (x === 'value1')
    ...
    [break]

  case 'value2':  // if (x === 'value2')
    ...
    [break]

  default:
    ...
    [break]
}
```

This checks the value of `x` with first `case 'value1'` and will continue until the equality is found. If no case is matched then the `default` code will be executed.

let's see a simple example of `switch` statement.

```js
let a = 2 + 2;

switch (a) {
  case 3:
    console.log('Too small');
    break;
  case 4:
    console.log('Exactly!');
    break;
  case 5:
    console.log('Too big');
    break;
  default:
    console.log("I don't know such values");
}
```

The `switch` starts to compare `a` with all cases:
- first case `3`, it doesn't match `a`
- second case `4`, it matches and console will shows 'Exactly!'.

What if you forgot add `break` between `case`? The execution continues with `case` without any checks and we will see `Too small`, 'Exactly!`, and `Too big` on browser's console. 


Let's convert FizzBuzz example to `switch` statement.

```js
for (let i = 1; i < 101; i++) {
  switch (true) {
    case i % 15 === 0:
      console.log('FizzBuzz');
      break;
    case i % 3 === 0:
      console.log('Fizz');
      break;
    case i % 5 === 0:
      console.log('Buzz');
      break;
    default:
      console.log(i);
  }
}
```
## Day 8

### What is hoisting? 

```js
console.log(message); // return undefined
var message = 'hello'
```

In JavaScript, hoisting allows you to puse function and variables before they're declared. Which is why the code above return `undefined` value in the browser's console.

### Variable hoisting

There are 3 ways to declare a variables with `var`, `let`, and `const`. 

Let's see `var` hoisting. If you copy the code below on your JavaScript file, the first console.log returns `undefeind` while second console.log returns `hello`.

```js
console.log(message); // undefined
var message = 'hello'
console.log(message); // hello
```

Remember, JavaScript reads code from top to bottom. If you are trying to console.log the variable before it is declared, it will retun `undefined` if you use `var` to declare. 

now, let's see `let` and `const` hoisting

```js
console.log(message); // reference error: cannot access 'message' before initialization
let message = 'hello'
```

If you change `let` to `const` in the code above, the console will show the same error.

In short, variable declared with `var` is hoisted and **initialized** its value to `undefeind`, while `let` and `const` are hoisted but **not initialized**. Which is why `let` and `const` returns `ReferenceError`. JavaScript is weird in this case. It allows us to use variable before declaration and it leads to alot of confused. 

## Day 9

Since I learned about the `switch` statement few days ago and wanted to use `switch` for practice. Then I saw that Ania Kubów has a new video [Learn JavaScript by building 7 games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec8vSKJuZTk) on FreeCodeCamp channel. I decided to made a simple rock paper sicssors game. First, I wrote the script with `if else` statement and then wrote `switch` statement after to see the length of code and readabiliy between both statements.

## Day 10

I built a memory card game from [Learn JavaScript by building 7 games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec8vSKJuZTk). I utilized the `for` loop to create images and set attributes. I usually use the `forEach` method. The `this` keyword is a bit difficult to understand and depend on the function, but in this case, `this` will return the information of the **clicked** element such as `data-id`.

## Day 11

I built a whack a mole card game from [Learn JavaScript by building 7 games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec8vSKJuZTk). I utilized the `forEach` to to listen `mousedown` addEventListener. The time and score will update accordingly. I never knew that `mousedown` and `click` are different. 

`mousedown`: the event is fired when a pointing device button is **initially** pressed.
`click`: the event is fired after **a full click action** occours.

## Day 12

Continuing making a game from [Learn JavaScript by building 7 games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec8vSKJuZTk). This game is interesting to make and utilized `AND` and `OR` operators to check collisions. Need to take the size of block and ball into account. I found the chainning of `AND` and `OR` is confusing me. I gotta to spend more time on logical oeprators, espically the `||` and `&&`.

## Day 13

I have read Eloquent JS before, and I didn't really understand a lot of things. Let's read the book chapter 1 to 3 again, I get it this time! Also, I didn't realize that variable is also called `binding`

[Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)

## Day 14

done with lessons 1 to 4 (variables, conditionals, function and scope)! Get that spaced repetition and recall in!

[Intro to JavaSript on codeademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)

## Day 15

### All about git

Read [Git from the Bottom Up](https://jwiegley.github.io/git-from-the-bottom-up/) to get familar with git terms and how it work

#### terms:

- **repository**: it is a collection of commits, show what project's working tree looks like in the past date, wether on your machine or someone else's. It also defines `HEAD`, which idenfities the branch or commit the current working tree stemmed from. It also contains branches and tags.
- **HEAD**: it is define what is currently checked out.
- **the index**: aka the `staging area`, it is where git confirms your change, one by one before doing a commit.
- **working tree**: any directory on your file system which has a repository assoicated wiht it. It is usually in the `.git` folder
- **commit**: it is snapshot of your working tree at the some point. This is also the revision history.
- **branch**: it is a name for a commit, and also called referance. It is the parentage of a commit which defines its history, and considered notion of a "revision history"
- **tag**: it is also a name fora commit, similar to a branch, except that it always name the same commit, and can have its own description text.

## Day 16

### Passed by Value vs Passed by Reference

**Primitives** are passed by value, meaning their values are copied and then placed somewhere else in the memory. 7 primitive date: string, number, bigint, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol.

**Non-primitive** type is object, and they are passed by reference, meaning their properties are not separately in the memory.

```js
// objects are passed by reference
let obj = {
  name: "John",
};
let newObj = obj; 
newObj.name = "Peter"; 
// Since both point to the same place...
console.log(obj); // {name: Peter}
console.log(newObj); // {name: Peter}

let arr = [1, 2, 3];
let newArr = arr;
newArr.push(4);
console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
console.log(newArr); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

You can use `Object.assign()` or use the spread operator `{...}` to copy the object. Keep in mind, this method is a `shallow copy`. This means the object only can be copied one level deep, not 2 levels deep.

How do you copy an entire object? Use `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(originalObj))` and this will copy the nestedKey. Keep it in mind, this method could impact performance.

```js
const originalObj = {
  nested: {
    nestedKey: "nestedValue",
  },
  key: "value",
};
const assignObj = originalObj; // nestedkey value will change
const shallowObj = { ...originalObj }; // nestedkey value will change
const deepObj = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(originalObj)); // nestedkey balue will NOT change
// deepObj clones all parts of the object to a new memory address
```

## Day 17 

done with Codecademy lessons, array, loops, iterators `high-order function, forEach(), map(), filter(), reduce(), and findIndex()` and a bit on objects ! Get that spaced repetition and recall in!

[Intro to JavaSript on codeademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)

## Day 18

done with Codecademy lesson objects! I decided to keep today light.

[Intro to JavaSript on codeademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)

## Day 19

- Portfolio site: added most informaiton (projects, contact form, and skill sections)
- Did 2 or 3 small problems on codewars to start working on thinking process and as usual, practicing with JavaScript.


[portfolio](https://github.com/victoriacheng15/portfolio)

## Day 20

- Did 3 codewars problems by listing steps on what I need to do to get the solution.


#### Rock paper scissors solution: 
Let's play! You have to return which player won! In case of a draw return Draw!.

```js
const rps = (p1, p2) => {
  switch(p1+p2) {
      case 'scissorspaper':
      case 'rockscissors':
      case 'paperrock':
        return 'Player 1 won!'
        break;
      case 'scissorsrock':
      case 'paperscissors':
      case 'rockpaper':
        return 'Player 2 won!'
        break;
      default:
        return 'Draw!'
        break;
  }
};
```

#### Grasshopper - Summation
Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

```js
const summation = function (num) {
  // set sum to 0
  // loop from 0 to num
  // add sum with i
  let sum = 0
  for(let i = 0; i <= num; i++) {
     sum += i
  }
  return sum
}
```

#### Fake - binary
Given a string of digits, you should replace any digit below 5 with '0' and any digit 5 and above with '1'. Return the resulting string.

```js
function fakeBin(x){
  // split string
  // map the array 
  // check number is greater or less than 5
  // join them
  return x.split('').map(num => num < 5 ? '0' : '1').join('')
}
```

## Day 21

- did 3 codewars problems

### Can we divide it?
Your task is to create the functionisDivideBy (or is_divide_by) to check if an integer number is divisible by both integers a and b.

```js
function isDivideBy(number, a, b) {
  // checke the answer is integer or not after divide
  return Number.isInteger(number / a) && Number.isInteger(number / b) ? true : false
}
```

### Will you make it?
You were camping with your friends far away from home, but when it's time to go back, you realize that your fuel is running out and the nearest pump is 50 miles away! You know that, on average, your car runs on about 25 miles per gallon. There are 2 gallons left.

```js
const zeroFuel = (distanceToPump, mpg, fuelLeft) => {
  // TODO
  // check total fuel need with mpg and fuelLeft
  // check if totalfeul is equal or greater than then distanceToPump
  // if equal or greater, return true
  // if less, return false
  return distanceToPump <= (mpg * fuelLeft) ? true : false
};
```

### counting the sheep
Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).

```js
function countSheeps(arrayOfSheep) {
  // set up empty array to store true
  // check to see which one is true with filter
  // push to sorted array
  let sorted = []
  arrayOfSheep.filter(check => {
    if(check === true) {
      sorted.push(check)
    }
  })
  return sorted.length
}
```

## Day 22

- Worked on 2 codewars problems and learned couple things
  - Using Array(x).keys() to fill the array based on the `x`
  - Using new Set() to store unqiue values of any type
- Added responsive design to my portfolio site

codewars problems:

- Count the divisors of a number

Count the number of divisors of a positive integer n.
```js
function getDivisorsCnt(n) {
  // create and fill the array based on n
  // filter out decimal values with reminder
  return [...Array(n + 1).keys()].filter((num) => n % num === 0).length;
}
```

- Isograms

An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

```js
function isIsogram(str) {
  // convert to lower case
  // use Set() method that store unique values of any type
  // check length
  // - if same lenght, mean no repeat
  // - if different length, mean repeat
  return new Set(str.toLowerCase()).size === str.length;
}
```

## Day 23

- Worked on 2 codewars JS problems
- Recap: I should look into `recursion` next

### Sum of Numbers

Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between and including them and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

```js
function getSum(a,b) {
  // 1. check if a === b, return a
  // 2. check if a < b, loop and add through lowest to highest numbers
  // 3. check if b < a, loop and add through lowest to highest numbers
  let total = 0;  
  if (a === b) { return a };
  
  if (a < b) {
    for (let i = a; i <= b; i++) {
      total += i;
    }
    return total;
  }
  
  if (b < a) {
    for (let i = b; i <= a; i++) {
      total += i;
    }
    return total;
  }
}
```

### Remove the minimum

Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. Do not mutate the original array/list. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with a lower index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.

Don't change the order of the elements that are left.

```js
function removeSmallest(numbers) {
  // leave the original array alone
  // use Math.min()
  // use apply() for the num array
  // find index of the min and then remove with splice
  const min = Math.min.apply(null,numbers);
  const newArr = numbers.slice(0);
  const minIndex = newArr.indexOf(min)
  newArr.splice(minIndex, 1);
  return newArr;
}
```

## Day 24

- redid 2 problems on codewars with different solutions

### Recursion

Recursion is a process of calling itself. A function that calls itself is called a recursive function.
In general, the recursion function looks like the code block below. Make sure have `if else` statemenet, otherwise, it can run forever.

resources:
- [Programiz recursion](https://www.programiz.com/javascript/recursion)
- [JavaScript Info recursion](https://javascript.info/recursion)

```js
function recurse() {
    if(condition) {
        recurse();
    }
    else {
        // stop calling recurse()
    }
}

recurse();
```

Let's see an example with countdown

```js
const countdown = (num) => {
  // logging the n
  console.log(num);
  // decrease num value by 1
  const nextNumber = num - 1;
  // prevent infinite loop, it stops when reach 0
  if (nextNumber > 0) {
    countdown(nextNumber);
  }
};
countdown(10);
