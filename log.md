## Day 1 

I made a simple background color picker to show cofffee colors! It also changes images once you clicked! I used onclick event listener instead of addEventListener. Personally, I dont use onclick event listener function but, I am curious what are the differences between onclick and addEventListener. 

Diffenences: 
| type              | addEventListener               | onclick                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| number of event   | many events                    | single event              |
| event propagation | can control with 3rd arguement | cant control              |
| how to add        | `<script>` or  JS file         | HTML attribute or JS file |
| compability       | Doesn't work on older IE       | works in all brwosers     |
